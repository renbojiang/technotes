# AWS Basic Concepts

## Account

> Note that although requested AWS accounts are **integrated accounts**, very occasionally requests are for non-integrated accounts (**ad hoc accounts**). The request process follows much the same steps as those listed here, but ad hoc accounts come with different roles, architecture, and limitations. Please contact a cloud ambassador for details if you think you need an ad hoc account instead of an integrated account.
