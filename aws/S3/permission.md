# Permission Management

>By default, all Amazon S3 resources—buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, `lifecycle` configuration and `website`configuration)—are private: only the resource owner, an AWS account that created it, can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy.
