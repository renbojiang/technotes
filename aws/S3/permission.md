# Permission Management

>By default, all Amazon S3 resources—buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, `lifecycle` configuration and `website`configuration)—are private: only the resource owner, an AWS account that created it, can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy.

- **resource-based policies**
Access policies you attach to your resources (buckets and objects) are referred to as resource-based policies. For example, bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs) are resource-based policies.
- **user-based policies**
You can also attach access policies to users in your account. These are called user policies.
